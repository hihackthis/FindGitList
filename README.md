# Find-GitHub-List


## Description
---

> This program searches for a keyword in the title on a GitHub page.

This program is for looking up the name and description of a tool published here on GitHub that you favored in a personal text file, which contains URLs. The program will search for this word in the `title tag` of the URL. Note: the program will look for **one**, and only **one**, word at a time.

## Requirements
---

##### Modules:

- [x] colorama (Colored text using ANSI sequences)
- [x] lxml (To offer support for XPath, RelaxNG, XML Schema etc)
- [x] re (RegEx, or Regular Expression)
- [x] requests (Dealing with HTTP requests)
- [x] time (Manipulate time)

## How to run
---

1. Create a file containing GitHub URLs one below the other.
2. Like this:

        GitHub_URL1
        GitHub_URL2
        GitHub_URL3
        GitHub_URL4

3. At the Terminal run the command:

    > python3 findGit.py

4. Choose option 1 to search <**ENTER**>
5. Type the file path <**ENTER**>
6. Enter a word to search <**ENTER**>

PS: If the file is located in the same folder as the program, then just type the file name.

## Motivation
---

I created this tool in Python 3 to solve a personal problem: facilitate my searches in My Favorites.

Developed and tested on Debian with a black wallpaper, see the image above.

**Note**: program colors can be easily changed in code, for example, if it is written RED, replace it with BLUE (capital letter). More info: 

###### [Colorama Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/ "Colorama Homepage")

I'm not a professional programmer, I'm a Python enthusiast and I'm open-minded (and code too:trollface:) to receive any feedback.

## Final words 

Have fun! :money_mouth_face:
